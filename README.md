Identification & Optical character recognition (OCR) for Structured Documents
Documents that are used during the process of daily operations can be stored as image files or in PDF.

The documents can be of varied types such as:
Application forms
Customer Request forms
Account Opening Forms
KYC Documents
Agreements
Reports
Certificates
Confidential Reports
Account Statements
Varied document formats including OVDs

For this kind of documents (structured or unstructured), OCR needs to be performed for direct obtention of data from the document, suitable tagging as well as to make the content searchable. This helps in customer onboarding as well as customer relationship enhancement during the lifecycle of any deposit or loan account / service.

Officially Valid Documents â€“ OVDs such as Aadhaar card, Driving License, Voter Identity card, PAN card

Solution Expected:
The following are the expectations from the prototype:

Document / Image can be:
Standardised KYC
Structured Document
Unstructured documents

Obtain from document / image:
Document Identification
Customer / Account Identification
Structured Text within Document
Unstructured Text within Document
Photograph of Customer
Official Signature
Customer Signature
Document Attestation

In case of certain documents such as Aadhar Cards, obtaining the Aadhar number & saving a copy of the document after masking the Aadhar Number from within the document.

Classify the OCR accuracy Score as per clarity of Text in document
